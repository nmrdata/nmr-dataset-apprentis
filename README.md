This series of exercises is provided by Noah Mayor and Julia Villiger, apprentice at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

It includes the full dataset (proton, carbon (coupled and decoupled), cosy, hsqc and hmbc) of common solvents.

It is divided in 5 series in order to show to the students the different NMR experiments:

- proton spectrum
- coupled and decoupled carbon spectra
- COSY spectrum
- HSQC / HMBC spectra
- Full dataset

You can either provide the link to all the series or to a specific series.
