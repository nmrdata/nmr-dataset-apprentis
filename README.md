This series of exercises is provided by Noah Mayor and Julia Villiger, trainee chemistry laboratory assistants, at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

For each sample the proton (1H) spectrum is provided.

It is divided into 3 series in order to show students the different NMR experiments:

- NMR of organic solvents
- Simple exercises
- Medium exercises
- Difficult exercises

You can either provide the link to all the series or to a specific series.

This series is part of a

- 1H : Only proton NMR is provided
- 13C : 13C (could be coupled of decoupled) spectra are provided
- COSY : Only COSY spectra are provided
- HSQC / HMBC : Both spectra are provided
- Full : We provide all the spectra available
